    <p class="intro">Madagascar, a huge island nation off the southeast coast of Africa, is home to thousands of animal species – like lemurs – found nowhere else, plus rainforests, beaches and reefs. Near the busy capital, Antananarivo, is Ambohimanga, a hillside complex of royal palaces and burial grounds, as well as the “Avenue of the Baobabs,” a dirt road lined by massive centuries-old trees.</p>
    <p class="author">Denmark is a country comprising the Jutland peninsula and its offshore islands, linking Northern Europe and Scandinavia via the Öresund bridge. On Zealand, the capital, Copenhagen is home to the rococo Frederiksstaden district and its royal palaces, Tivoli pleasure gardens and the “Little Mermaid” statue. On neighboring Funen is Odense, storyteller Hans Christian Andersen’s hometown, with a medieval core of cobblestone streets and half-timbered houses.</p>
   <p>Maine, the northeasternmost state in the U.S., is known for its rocky coastline, long maritime history and abundant parks and reserves, including the famed granite and spruce islands of Acadia National Park. Moose are plentiful in Baxter State Park, which encompasses towering Mt. Katahdin, endpoint of the Appalachian Trail. Deep, wide Lake Sebago and other Lakes Region waters are popular for fishing and boating.
